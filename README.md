# PythonBasics
Collection of simple scripts

1_BasicPythonOperators.py
File contains solution for a simple task: 
create list of 100 random numbers from 0 to 1000
sort list from min to max (without using sort())
calculate average for even and odd numbers

2_Collections.py
File contains solution for a simple task for generationa and work with collections in Python.
1. Create a list of random number of dicts (from 2 to 10)
Dict's random numbers of keys should be letter,
Dict's values should be a number (0-100),
example: [{'a': 5, 'b': 7, 'g': 11}, {'a': 3, 'c': 35, 'g': 42}]
2. Get previously generated list of dicts and create one common dict:
If dicts have same key, we will take max value, and rename key with dict number with max value
If key is only in one dict - take it as is,
Example: {'a_1': 5, 'b': 7, 'c': 35, 'g_2': 42}
